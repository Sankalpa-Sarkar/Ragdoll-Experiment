# Ragdoll-Experiment
A self-interest experiment in Unity 3D and scripted in C#, this explores the physics of a rag-doll and the scripts required for the necessary ragdoll action. The coding of the scripts in this project was done in C# language on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, aided by the Unity Scripting Reference as well as the Microsoft Azure .NET Coding Reference. The game is built on the Unity 3D platform developed by Unity Technologies and is intended as an experiment into the understanding of the ragdoll physics and the necessary script to connect each rig with the character joint, RigidBody and Capsule Collider.
